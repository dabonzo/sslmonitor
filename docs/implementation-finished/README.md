## Historical Data Tracking Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Oct 2025)
**Location**: [PHASE1_HISTORICAL_DATA.md](PHASE1_HISTORICAL_DATA.md)

**What It Does**:
- Creates 4 database tables (monitoring_results, summaries, alerts, events)
- Implements 4 Eloquent models with relationships
- Establishes composite index for query performance

**Key Deliverables**:
- 4 database migrations
- 4 Eloquent models with relationships
- Comprehensive tests (migration + model tests)
- Database foundation ready for integration

**Test Coverage**: 530+ tests passing

### Phase 2: Event System & Data Capture (Oct 2025)
**Location**: [PHASE2_HISTORICAL_DATA.md](PHASE2_HISTORICAL_DATA.md)

**What It Does**:
- Fires events for each monitoring check (started, completed, failed)
- Queued listeners capture data automatically
- Horizon queues process data asynchronously
- Manual vs scheduled checks tracked separately

**Key Deliverables**:
- 4 Laravel events
- 4 queued listeners for data capture
- Modified CheckMonitorJob to fire events
- Modified ImmediateWebsiteCheckJob for manual tracking
- Configured Horizon queues
- Integration tests for event system

**Test Coverage**: 549+ tests passing

### Phase 3: Dashboard Integration & Visualization (Oct 19, 2025)
**Location**: [PHASE3_HISTORICAL_DATA.md](PHASE3_HISTORICAL_DATA.md)

**What It Does**:
- Service layer with 6 data retrieval methods
- 3 API endpoints for historical data
- 4 Vue components with Chart.js integration
- Dashboard integration showing trends and statistics

**Key Deliverables**:
- MonitoringHistoryService (6 methods)
- MonitorHistoryController (3 endpoints)
- MonitoringHistoryChart.vue (response time trends)
- UptimeTrendCard.vue (uptime statistics)
- RecentChecksTimeline.vue (check history)
- SslExpirationTrendCard.vue (expiration countdown)

**Test Coverage**: 564 tests passing, 6.88s execution

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Intelligence (Oct 24-27, 2025)
**Location**: [PHASE4_HISTORICAL_DATA.md](PHASE4_HISTORICAL_DATA.md)

**What It Does**:
- Data aggregation (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly summaries)
- Alert correlation system (automatic alert creation)
- Data retention policies (90-day raw data, 1+ year summaries)
- Reporting capabilities (CSV export, summary reports)
- 5 scheduled jobs via Laravel Scheduler

**Key Deliverables**:
- AggregateMonitoringSummariesJob (memory-efficient aggregation)
- AlertCorrelationService (intelligent alert management)
- PruneMonitoringDataCommand (data retention)
- MonitoringReportService (CSV & report generation)
- MonitoringReportController (report endpoints)
- 5 scheduled jobs (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly aggregations + pruning)

**Test Coverage**: 564 tests passing, 6.14s execution

## Historical Data System Architecture

### Complete Data Flow

```
1. Monitoring Check Runs
   ↓
2. CheckMonitorJob Fires Events
   ├── MonitoringCheckStarted
   ├── MonitoringCheckCompleted / MonitoringCheckFailed
   └── MonitoringBatchCompleted
   ↓
3. Queued Listeners Capture Data
   ├── RecordMonitoringResult → monitoring_results table
   ├── RecordMonitoringFailure → monitoring_results (error records)
   ├── UpdateMonitoringSummaries → monitoring_check_summaries
   └── CheckAlertConditions → monitoring_alerts
   ↓
4. Scheduled Jobs Process Data
   ├── Hourly Aggregation (:05 every hour)
   ├── Daily Aggregation (01:00 AM)
   ├── Weekly Aggregation (Monday 02:00 AM)
   ├── Monthly Aggregation (1st day 03:00 AM)
   └── Data Pruning (04:00 AM - delete 90+ days)
   ↓
5. Dashboard & API Access
   ├── /api/monitors/{id}/history (recent checks)
   ├── /api/monitors/{id}/trends (chart data)
   ├── /api/monitors/{id}/summary (statistics)
   ├── /api/monitors/{id}/reports/export-csv (downloads)
   └── Vue Components Display Data
```

### Database Schema

**4 Core Tables**:
1. **monitoring_results** - Raw check data (90-day retention)
2. **monitoring_check_summaries** - Hourly/daily/weekly/monthly aggregations
3. **monitoring_alerts** - Alert lifecycle management
4. **monitoring_events** - Event audit trail

**Composite Index**: `idx_monitor_website_time` on (monitor_id, website_id, started_at)
- Provides 90%+ performance improvement for dashboard queries

### Performance Metrics

- **Full Test Suite**: 564 tests passing in 6.14s (well under 20s target)
- **API Response Time**: < 100ms with caching
- **Dashboard Load**: < 2 seconds
- **Aggregation Efficiency**: SQL-based (not collection-based)
- **Data Pruning**: Chunked deletion (memory safe)

## How These Plans Were Implemented

Each completed implementation followed this workflow:

1. **Read the plan**: Detailed implementation plan in `docs/implementation-plans/`
2. **Execute phases**: Follow phase-by-phase implementation guide
3. **Use specialized agents**: Laravel backend, testing, and documentation agents
4. **Test thoroughly**: Maintain 100% test pass rate
5. **Document**: Create user-facing and technical documentation
6. **Move to completed**: Transfer from implementation-plans/ to implementation-finished/
