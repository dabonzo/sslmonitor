## 📊 Implementation Summary

### Part 0: Monitor Model Helper (Prerequisite)

**File Modified**: `app/Models/Monitor.php`

Added helper methods to handle the critical architectural constraint that the Monitor model does NOT have a `website_id` column:

```php
public function getWebsiteIdAttribute(): ?int
{
    return $this->monitoringResults()->latest()->value('website_id');
}

public function monitoringResults(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(MonitoringResult::class, 'monitor_id');
}
```

**Key Benefit**: Allows `$monitor->website_id` to work via accessor while keeping the architecture explicit.

---

### Part 1: Summary Aggregation System

#### Files Created

**1. `app/Jobs/AggregateMonitoringSummariesJob.php`** (4.5KB)
- Aggregates monitoring data into time-based summaries
- Supports periods: `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`
- Chunks monitors (100 at a time) for memory efficiency
- Uses SQL aggregation for performance
- **Correctly retrieves `website_id` from MonitoringResult** (NOT from monitor)
- Calculates: total checks, success/failure counts, response times, uptime percentages, SSL stats

**Key Implementation Pattern**:
```php
$stats = MonitoringResult::where('monitor_id', $monitor->id)
    ->whereBetween('started_at', [$dateRange['start'], $dateRange['end']])
    ->select([
        DB::raw('website_id'),  // ✅ Get from results
        DB::raw('COUNT(*) as total_checks'),
        // ... other aggregations
    ])
    ->groupBy('website_id')  // ✅ Group by website_id
    ->first();
```

**2. Scheduled Jobs** (`routes/console.php`)

Added 4 aggregation schedules:
- **Hourly**: Runs at :05 every hour
- **Daily**: Runs at 01:00 AM
- **Weekly**: Runs Monday at 02:00 AM
- **Monthly**: Runs 1st day at 03:00 AM

All use `->withoutOverlapping()` to prevent concurrent executions.

---

### Part 2: Alert Correlation System

#### Files Created

**1. `app/Services/AlertCorrelationService.php`** (5.8KB)
- Creates and manages monitoring alerts
- Tracks alert lifecycle (creation → acknowledgment → resolution)
- Auto-resolves alerts when conditions improve

**Alert Types**:
- `ssl_expiring` - Certificate expires ≤ 7 days (critical if ≤ 3 days)
- `uptime_down` - 3+ consecutive failures within 1 hour (critical)
- `performance_degradation` - Response time > 5000ms (warning)

**Key Methods**:
```php
checkAndCreateAlerts(MonitoringResult $result): void
acknowledgeAlert(MonitoringAlert $alert, int $userId, ?string $note): void
resolveAlert(MonitoringAlert $alert, ?string $resolution): void
autoResolveAlerts(MonitoringResult $result): void
```

**CRITICAL**: All alert creation uses `$result->website_id` (from MonitoringResult), never `$monitor->website_id`.

#### Files Modified

**1. `app/Listeners/RecordMonitoringResult.php`**
- Integrated AlertCorrelationService
- Automatically checks and creates alerts after recording monitoring results
- Automatically resolves alerts when conditions improve

```php
$this->alertService->checkAndCreateAlerts($result);
$this->alertService->autoResolveAlerts($result);
```

---

### Part 3: Data Retention Policies

#### Files Created

**1. `app/Console/Commands/PruneMonitoringDataCommand.php`** (1.9KB)
- Artisan command: `monitoring:prune-old-data`
- Default retention: 90 days
- Options: `--days=N`, `--dry-run`
- Features:
  - Confirmation before deletion
  - Progress bar for long operations
  - Chunking (1000 records) for efficiency
  - Dry-run mode for testing

**2. Scheduled Job** (`routes/console.php`)
- Runs daily at 04:00 AM
- Automatically prunes data older than 90 days
- Uses `->withoutOverlapping()` to prevent conflicts

---

### Part 4: Reporting Capabilities

#### Files Created

**1. `app/Services/MonitoringReportService.php`** (2.7KB)
- CSV export generation with proper escaping
- Summary reports for 7d/30d/90d periods
- Daily breakdown aggregations

**Key Methods**:
```php
generateCsvExport(Monitor $monitor, Carbon $startDate, Carbon $endDate): string
getSummaryReport(Monitor $monitor, string $period = '30d'): array
getDailyBreakdown(Monitor $monitor, Carbon $startDate, Carbon $endDate): array
```

**CSV Format**:
```
Timestamp,Status,Uptime Status,Response Time (ms),SSL Status,Days Until Expiration,Error
2025-10-19T10:30:00Z,success,up,250,valid,45,
```

**Summary Report Structure**:
```json
{
  "period": "30d",
  "total_checks": 150,
  "success_count": 145,
  "failure_count": 5,
  "avg_response_time": 234.56,
  "uptime_percentage": 96.67,
  "ssl_checks": 30,
  "ssl_valid": 30,
  "ssl_issues": 0
}
```

**2. `app/Http/Controllers/MonitoringReportController.php`** (1.8KB)
- RESTful controller for report endpoints
- Constructor injection of MonitoringReportService
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/monitors/{monitor}/reports/export-csv` - CSV download
  - `GET /api/monitors/{monitor}/reports/summary` - JSON summary
  - `GET /api/monitors/{monitor}/reports/daily-breakdown` - JSON daily stats

**3. Routes** (`routes/web.php`)
- Added authenticated route group
- Prefix: `api/monitors/{monitor}/reports`
- All routes require authentication

**2. Model Updates**
- Added `HasFactory` trait to `app/Models/MonitoringResult.php`

## 🏗️ Architectural Compliance

### Critical Constraint Handled Correctly

**Issue**: Monitor model does NOT have a `website_id` column.

**Solution**: All implementations correctly retrieve `website_id` from `MonitoringResult` records:

```php
// ✅ CORRECT - In AggregateMonitoringSummariesJob
$stats = MonitoringResult::where('monitor_id', $monitor->id)
    ->select([DB::raw('website_id'), ...])
    ->groupBy('website_id')
    ->first();

MonitoringCheckSummary::create([
    'website_id' => $stats->website_id,  // From query result
]);

// ✅ CORRECT - In AlertCorrelationService
MonitoringAlert::create([
    'website_id' => $result->website_id,  // From result parameter
]);
```

**Verified**: No instances of `$monitor->website_id` in production code (except via accessor).

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Architectural Insights

1. **Indirect Relationships**: The Monitor-Website relationship is mediated through MonitoringResult, requiring careful handling of `website_id` retrieval.

2. **SQL Aggregations**: Using database-level aggregations (GROUP BY, SUM, AVG) is significantly faster than collection-based aggregations for large datasets.

3. **Alert Deduplication**: Checking for existing alerts before creation prevents notification spam and improves user experience.

4. **Auto-Resolution**: Automatically resolving alerts when conditions improve reduces manual overhead and keeps alert lists clean.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Chunking**: Processing records in chunks (100 monitors, 1000 deletions) prevents memory exhaustion.

2. **Without Overlapping**: Scheduler's `withoutOverlapping()` prevents resource conflicts during long-running jobs.

3. **Test Performance**: Using `UsesCleanDatabase` trait instead of `RefreshDatabase` dramatically improves test speed.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Phase 4 is complete. The Historical Data Tracking system now has:
- ✅ Data capture (Phase 1)
- ✅ Event system (Phase 2)
- ✅ Dashboard visualization (Phase 3)
- ✅ Advanced features (Phase 4)

### Recommended Actions

1. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   git add .

   # Create PR to main branch
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Review scheduler job execution via Laravel Horizon
   - Monitor disk usage growth of `monitoring_results` table
   - Verify aggregations create correct summaries

3. **Future Enhancements** (Optional):
   - Add email notifications for critical alerts
   - Create custom retention policies per monitor
