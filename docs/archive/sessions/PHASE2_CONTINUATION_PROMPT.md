# SSL Monitor v4 - Phase 2 Continuation Prompt

**Purpose**: Copy-paste ready prompt to continue monitoring data tracking implementation in Phase 2.

---

## ðŸš€ **Phase 2 Continuation Prompt**

```
I'm continuing work on the comprehensive monitoring data tracking system for SSL Monitor v4. Please read the continuation context file to understand where we left off and what needs to be done next.

**Reference file**: `/home/bonzo/code/ssl-monitor-v4/SESSION_CONTEXT_monitoring_data_tracking_phase2.md`

Phase 1 is complete (database schema, models, events implemented) and I'm ready to proceed with Phase 2: Data Capture Integration. The foundation infrastructure is production-ready.

Current priority: Modify `app/Jobs/CheckMonitorJob.php` to integrate event firing into existing monitoring jobs while maintaining backward compatibility.
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Specific Task Prompts**

### **Start Phase 2 - Job Integration**
```
Continue Phase 2 of monitoring data tracking implementation for SSL Monitor v4.

Read the continuation context file and begin with the first priority task: Modify `app/Jobs/CheckMonitorJob.php` to integrate `MonitoringCheckStarted` event at the beginning of the `handle()` method.

Key requirements:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing monitoring functionality
- Capture timing data accurately (started_at, completed_at, duration_ms)
- Fire appropriate events for both SSL and uptime checks
- Handle error scenarios with `MonitoringCheckFailed` events
- Use existing MCP tools for verification (Laravel Boost, Playwright)

Focus on integration at lines 85-120 in CheckMonitorJob where the main check execution logic occurs.
```

### **Continue with Event Listeners**
```
Continue with Phase 2 monitoring data tracking implementation.

I've already integrated events into the monitoring jobs. Now I need to create the event listeners:

1. Create `app/Listeners/RecordMonitoringResult.php` listener
2. Create `app/Listeners/UpdateMonitoringSummaries.php` listener
3. Create `app/Listeners/CheckAlertConditions.php` listener
4. Register listeners in `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`

Use the continuation context file for detailed implementation requirements and code examples. Ensure listeners handle both SSL and uptime check results properly.
```

### **Immediate Website Check Job Integration**
```
Continue Phase 2 monitoring data tracking implementation.

I need to modify `app/Jobs/ImmediateWebsiteCheckJob.php` to integrate event firing for manual checks:

Key requirements:
- Add `MonitoringCheckStarted` event with user attribution
- Add `MonitoringCheckCompleted` event with results
- Set `triggerType` to 'manual_immediate'
- Pass current user information from the job
- Maintain existing functionality without breaking changes

Focus on integration at lines 35-55 where immediate check handling occurs. Reference the continuation context for specific code examples.
```

### **Testing and Validation**
```
Continue Phase 2 monitoring data tracking implementation with testing and validation.

I've completed the event integration into monitoring jobs and created the listeners. Now I need to:

1. Test the complete integration workflow
2. Verify monitoring results are being recorded in the database
3. Confirm manual vs automatic checks are properly distinguished
4. Validate there's no performance degradation in existing monitoring
5. Test error handling and graceful failure scenarios

Use Laravel Boost MCP to verify database schema and check monitoring_results table. Run existing monitoring jobs to ensure events fire correctly and data is captured properly.
```

---

## ðŸ§ª **Testing-Specific Prompts**

### **Integration Testing - CheckMonitorJob**
```
Test Phase 2 monitoring data tracking integration for CheckMonitorJob.

I need to verify that the event integration into `app/Jobs/CheckMonitorJob.php` works correctly:

1. Create a test monitor and trigger a scheduled check
2. Verify `MonitoringCheckStarted` event fires with correct data
3. Verify `MonitoringCheckCompleted` or `MonitoringCheckFailed` events fire appropriately
4. Confirm monitoring results are saved to `monitoring_results` table
5. Check that timing data (started_at, completed_at, duration_ms) is accurate
6. Ensure no performance degradation in check execution time

Use MCP tools for verification and run existing monitoring jobs to test the integration.
```

### **Database Validation**
```
Validate Phase 2 monitoring data tracking database integration.

Use Laravel Boost MCP to verify the database schema and check that monitoring results are being recorded correctly:

1. Verify `monitoring_results` table exists with proper structure
2. Check that new records are being created for each monitoring check
3. Validate all required fields are populated correctly
4. Confirm relationships (monitor_id, website_id, triggered_by_user_id) work properly
5. Test both SSL and uptime check result recording
6. Verify error handling doesn't break monitoring functionality

Focus on data integrity and ensure the new historical data tracking doesn't impact existing monitoring performance.
```

### **Performance Testing**
```
Performance testing for Phase 2 monitoring data tracking integration.

I need to verify that the event system integration doesn't impact monitoring performance:

1. Benchmark existing check execution time before integration
2. Measure check execution time after event integration
3. Verify database writes don't block monitoring jobs
4. Test queue processing performance for event listeners
5. Monitor memory usage during batch monitoring operations
6. Ensure the system can handle expected monitoring volume

Use existing performance testing patterns from the codebase and verify that the 1-second test execution time requirement is still met.
