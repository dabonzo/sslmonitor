### âš¡ Quick Scenarios

#### Scenario: New Team Member
```javascript
// 1. Owner invites as VIEWER first
POST /settings/team/1/invite { email: "...", role: "VIEWER" }

// 2. Member accepts invitation (via email link)

// 3. Later, Owner or Admin promotes to ADMIN
PATCH /settings/team/1/members/10/role { role: "ADMIN" }
```

#### Scenario: Transfer Leadership
```javascript
// Old owner transfers to new owner
POST /settings/team/1/transfer-ownership { new_owner_id: 42 }

// Result: New owner is OWNER, old owner becomes ADMIN
```

#### Scenario: Share Website with Team
```javascript
// Transfer personal website to team
POST /ssl/websites/100/transfer-to-team { team_id: 1 }

// All team members can now see it
// OWNER and ADMIN can edit it
```

### ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Setting Up a New Team

```javascript
// 1. Create team
router.post('/settings/team', {
  name: 'DevOps Team',
  description: 'Monitoring all infrastructure'
});

// 2. Invite team members
router.post('/settings/team/1/invite', {
  email: 'admin@example.com',
  role: 'ADMIN'
});

router.post('/settings/team/1/invite', {
  email: 'developer@example.com',
  role: 'VIEWER'
});

// 3. Transfer existing websites to team
router.post('/ssl/websites/5/transfer-to-team', {
  team_id: 1
});
```

---

### Workflow 2: Changing Team Leadership

```javascript
// Scenario: Alice (OWNER) is leaving, wants Bob to take over

// 1. Alice promotes Bob to OWNER
router.post('/settings/team/1/transfer-ownership', {
  new_owner_id: 42 // Bob's user ID
});

// Result:
// - Bob is now OWNER
// - Alice is now ADMIN (still on team)

// 2. Bob removes Alice (if needed)
router.delete('/settings/team/1/members/10'); // Alice's user ID
```

---

### Workflow 3: Managing Team Member Access

```javascript
// Promote trusted viewer to admin
router.patch('/settings/team/1/members/15/role', {
  role: 'ADMIN'
});

// Demote inactive admin to viewer
router.patch('/settings/team/1/members/20/role', {
  role: 'VIEWER'
});

// Remove member who left company
router.delete('/settings/team/1/members/25');
```

---

### Workflow 4: Temporary Website Sharing

```javascript
// Share personal website with team temporarily

// 1. Transfer to team
router.post('/ssl/websites/100/transfer-to-team', {
  team_id: 1
});

// Team members can now view/edit (if ADMIN)

// 2. Later, transfer back to personal
router.post('/ssl/websites/100/transfer-to-personal');

// Website is now private again
```

---

## Best Practices

### Team Setup

1. **Always have at least 2 OWNERs** - Prevents lockout if primary owner is unavailable
2. **Use descriptive team names** - "Production Monitoring" not "Team 1"
3. **Add team description** - Helps members understand team purpose

### Role Assignment

1. **Start with VIEWER** - Give new members VIEWER first, upgrade as needed
2. **Limit OWNERs** - Too many can cause confusion about who manages the team
3. **Use ADMIN wisely** - For trusted members who actively manage websites

### Website Organization

1. **Group by environment** - Production team, Staging team, etc.
2. **Transfer strategically** - Only move websites to team if multiple people need access
3. **Regular cleanup** - Remove unused websites from teams

### Security

1. **Review members regularly** - Remove members who left the organization
2. **Audit role assignments** - Ensure appropriate access levels
3. **Use email verification** - Team invitations require valid email addresses
4. **Monitor ownership transfers** - Track when team ownership changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### "You do not have permission to manage this team"
- You must be the team OWNER
- Check your role: `/settings/team/{team}`

### "Cannot demote the last owner"
- Promote another member to OWNER first
- Or use transfer ownership feature

### "You cannot change your own role"
- Ask another team member (OWNER or ADMIN depending on role change)
- This prevents accidental permission loss

### "The new owner must be a team member"
- Add the user to the team first before transferring ownership
- Use invite feature: `/settings/team/{team}/invite`

### "Admins can only change roles between VIEWER and ADMIN"
- Ask a team OWNER to make OWNER role changes
- ADMINs cannot promote/demote to/from OWNER

---

## Data Model

### Teams Table
```
id, name, description, created_by_user_id, created_at, updated_at
```

### Team Members Table
```
id, team_id, user_id, role, joined_at, invited_by_user_id
```

### Websites Table (Team-related fields)
```
team_id (nullable), assigned_by_user_id (nullable), assigned_at (nullable)
```

### Team Invitations Table
```
id, team_id, email, role, token, expires_at, accepted_at, invited_by_user_id
```

## Migration from MANAGER Role

**Previous Roles:** OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, VIEWER
**Current Roles:** OWNER, ADMIN, VIEWER

### What Changed?
- **MANAGER role removed** - Consolidated into ADMIN
- **All existing MANAGERs converted to ADMIN** - Automatic migration
- **ADMIN permissions expanded** - Can now change VIEWER/ADMIN roles
