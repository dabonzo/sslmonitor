# Implementation Plans - SSL Monitor v4

This folder contains detailed implementation prompts for features that are designed but not yet implemented.

## Status Overview

| Plan | Status | Priority | Estimated Time | Dependencies |
|------|--------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| [Documentation Reorganization](DOCUMENTATION_REORGANIZATION.md) | ðŸ”´ Not Started | **HIGH** | 2.5-3 hours | None |
| [Phase 5 - Production Optimization](PHASE5_PRODUCTION_OPTIMIZATION.md) | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Medium | 2-3 hours | Phase 4 Complete âœ… |

## Recently Completed (Move to implementation-finished/)

| Plan | Completed | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| [Dynamic SSL Thresholds](DYNAMIC_SSL_THRESHOLDS.md) | âœ… Oct 27, 2025 | Intelligent percentage-based SSL expiration detection |
| Certificate Data Architecture | âœ… Oct 18, 2025 | Moved to `../implementation-finished/` |

## Implementation Order (Recommended)

### 1. Documentation Reorganization (START HERE) ðŸŽ¯
**Why First**: Clean up project structure, organize 13+ temporary files cluttering root directory, establish clear documentation categories.

**What It Does**:
- Creates category-based folder structure (core/, testing/, styling/, architecture/, features/)
- Moves all temporary reports and session files to archive/
- Consolidates scattered Phase 1-4 implementation docs
- Updates all cross-references and documentation index
- Results in clean root directory with only CLAUDE.md and README.md

**File**: `DOCUMENTATION_REORGANIZATION.md`
**Estimated Time**: 2.5-3 hours
**Agents Needed**: `documentation-writer` for phases 9, 11, 12, 13

---

### 2. Phase 5 - Production Optimization
**Why Second**: Performance optimizations for production deployment.

**What It Does**:
- Advanced caching strategies
- Database query optimization
- Asset optimization
- Performance monitoring

**File**: `PHASE5_PRODUCTION_OPTIMIZATION.md`
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Phase 4 Complete âœ…

## How to Use These Plans

### Starting a New Implementation

1. **Choose a plan** from the table above
2. **Open a new Claude Code session**
3. **Use this prompt**:
   ```
   Read @docs/implementation-plans/[PLAN_NAME].md and implement the feature exactly as specified. Use the recommended agents and follow the implementation phases.
   ```
4. **Example**:
   ```
   Read @docs/implementation-plans/CERTIFICATE_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md and implement the feature exactly as specified. Use the recommended agents and follow the implementation phases.
   ```

### After Implementation

1. Update the status in this README (ðŸ”´ â†’ ðŸŸ¡ â†’ ðŸŸ¢)
2. Add completion notes to the plan file
3. Update CLAUDE.md with the new feature (if applicable)
4. Move the plan file to `../implementation-finished/` folder

## Quick Reference

**Current Project Status**:
- âœ… Certificate Data Architecture: Complete (Oct 18, 2025)
- âœ… Dynamic SSL Thresholds: Complete (Oct 27, 2025)
- âœ… Phase 4 Historical Data: Complete
- ðŸ”´ Documentation Reorganization: Not started (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ðŸ”´ Phase 5 Production Optimization: Not started

**Test Suite**: 669 tests passing, 12 skipped (100% success rate) âœ…

**Next Priority**: Documentation Reorganization to clean up project structure before production deployment.
