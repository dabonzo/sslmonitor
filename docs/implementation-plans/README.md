## Recently Completed (Moved to implementation-finished/)

| Plan | Completed | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| [Documentation Reorganization](DOCUMENTATION_REORGANIZATION.md) | âœ… Oct 27, 2025 | Complete documentation reorganization with professional folder structure |
| [Dynamic SSL Thresholds](DYNAMIC_SSL_THRESHOLDS.md) | âœ… Oct 27, 2025 | Intelligent percentage-based SSL expiration detection |

## Implementation Order (Recommended)

### 1. Documentation Reorganization âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: âœ… Complete (October 27, 2025)

**What Was Accomplished**:
- âœ… Created category-based folder structure (core/, testing/, styling/, architecture/, features/)
- âœ… Moved all temporary reports and session files to archive/
- âœ… Consolidated scattered Phase 1-4 implementation docs
- âœ… Updated all cross-references and documentation index
- âœ… Clean root directory with only CLAUDE.md and README.md
- âœ… All 669 tests passing, 15.0s execution time

**Results**: Professional documentation structure with 56+ active files organized logically

---

### 2. Phase 5 - Production Optimization
**Why Second**: Performance optimizations for production deployment.

**What It Does**:
- Advanced caching strategies
- Database query optimization
- Asset optimization
- Performance monitoring

**File**: `PHASE5_PRODUCTION_OPTIMIZATION.md`
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Phase 4 Complete âœ…

## How to Use These Plans

### Starting a New Implementation

1. **Choose a plan** from the table above
2. **Open a new Claude Code session**
3. **Use this prompt**:
   ```
   Read @docs/implementation-plans/[PLAN_NAME].md and implement the feature exactly as specified. Use the recommended agents and follow the implementation phases.
   ```
4. **Example**:
   ```
   Read @docs/implementation-plans/CERTIFICATE_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md and implement the feature exactly as specified. Use the recommended agents and follow the implementation phases.
   ```

### After Implementation

1. Update the status in this README (ðŸ”´ â†’ ðŸŸ¡ â†’ ðŸŸ¢)
2. Add completion notes to the plan file
3. Update CLAUDE.md with the new feature (if applicable)
4. Move the plan file to `../implementation-finished/` folder
