## ðŸ’¡ **Example Complete Session Start**

```
New session for SSL Monitor v4. Review DEVELOPMENT_PRIMER.md and the current codebase. I'm planning to work on adding a new notification feature. What should I clarify before we start?

Specifically, I want to add email notifications when SSL certificates are expiring within 7 days. This should integrate with the existing monitoring system and use Laravel's mail functionality.
