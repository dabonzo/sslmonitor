  - [ ] Error handling with retry options
- [ ] **5.3** Update existing website management for manual checks
- [ ] **5.4** Add browser tests for immediate check UX
- [ ] **5.5** Test user experience thoroughly

**Expected Outcome**: Professional UX with instant feedback

### **Phase 6: Production Infrastructure**
- [ ] **6.1** Create supervisor configuration file
  - [ ] 2x workers for `immediate` queue

## 🔧 **Development Tools & Approach**

### **Laravel-boost MCP Integration**
- Use `application-info` for system state checks
- Use `list-artisan-commands` to verify new commands
- Use `tinker` for job testing and debugging
- Use `read-log-entries` for error analysis

### **Development Logging System**
**Enhanced logging channels for better debugging:**
- `daily` - General application logs
- `queue` - Queue processing logs
- `immediate-checks` - New website check logs
- `scheduler` - Task scheduling logs
- `errors` - Critical error tracking

### **Testing Strategy**
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, implement second
- **Pest4 Framework**: Modern testing with Laravel integration
- **Real Data**: Use development database with actual websites
- **Browser Testing**: Verify UX with Laravel Dusk
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure system can handle load

---

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- [ ] **Immediate Checks**: New websites checked within 30 seconds
- [ ] **Automation**: Zero manual commands required for monitoring
- [ ] **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for queue processing
- [ ] **Performance**: Handle 1000+ websites efficiently
- [ ] **UX**: Professional user experience with real-time feedback
- [ ] **Testing**: 100% test coverage for automation system
- [ ] **Production**: Supervisor-managed queue workers operational

---

## 🚨 **Risk Management & Dependencies**

### **Technical Dependencies**
- [ ] Redis server operational
- [ ] Supervisor service available
- [ ] Adequate server resources for queue workers
- [ ] Email service configuration working

### **Potential Risks**
- [ ] Queue worker failures
- [ ] High load during immediate checks
- [ ] Email delivery issues
- [ ] Frontend polling performance

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling in all jobs
- [ ] Queue prioritization and worker scaling
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for failed checks
- [ ] Rate limiting for immediate checks

## 📝 **Development Notes**

### **Key Decisions**
- **Queue System**: Redis (performance) over Database (simplicity)
- **Immediate Checks**: Separate high-priority queue
- **Frontend Updates**: Polling (simple) over WebSockets (complex)
- **Testing**: TDD approach for reliability

### **Architecture Choices**
- **Multi-queue Strategy**: Separate queues by priority and function
- **Job Granularity**: Individual website jobs for better failure isolation
- **Scheduler Integration**: Laravel native scheduler with single cron entry
- **Supervisor Management**: Professional queue worker supervision
