# Git Flow Workflow for SSL Monitor v3

## üîÑ Overview

SSL Monitor v3 follows **Git Flow branching model** for professional software development with clear separation between development, features, releases, and production code.

**Git Flow Benefits:**
- Clean separation between stable and development code
- Parallel feature development without conflicts
- Controlled release process with testing phases
- Emergency hotfix capability for production issues
- Clear history and auditable development process

## üå≥ Branch Structure

### Core Branches

#### `main` - Production Branch
- **Purpose**: Production-ready releases only
- **Protection**: Requires PR review and passing tests
- **Merges From**: `release/*` and `hotfix/*` branches only
- **Direct Commits**: ‚ùå Never commit directly to main

#### `develop` - Integration Branch
- **Purpose**: Integration point for all feature development
- **Current State**: Latest development version
- **Merges From**: `feature/*`, `release/*`, and `hotfix/*` branches
- **Direct Commits**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Only for minor fixes and documentation

### Supporting Branches

#### `feature/*` - Feature Development
- **Naming**: `feature/description-of-feature`
- **Branch From**: `develop`
- **Merge To**: `develop` (via Pull Request)
- **Lifecycle**: Created for feature ‚Üí developed ‚Üí merged ‚Üí deleted

#### `release/*` - Release Preparation
- **Naming**: `release/v1.0.0`
- **Branch From**: `develop`
- **Merge To**: `main` and `develop`
- **Purpose**: Final preparation, bug fixes, version bumping

#### `hotfix/*` - Emergency Production Fixes
- **Naming**: `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
- **Branch From**: `main`
- **Merge To**: `main` and `develop`
- **Purpose**: Critical production issues that can't wait for next release

## üöÄ Workflow Examples

### 1. Initial Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url> ssl-monitor-v3
cd ssl-monitor-v3

# Create and setup develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# Set up branch protection rules (done via GitHub/GitLab interface)
# - main: Require PR review + passing tests
# - develop: Require PR review
```

### 2. Feature Development Workflow

#### Starting a New Feature
```bash
# Ensure you're on latest develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/vristo-template-integration
git push -u origin feature/vristo-template-integration

# Verify branch setup
git branch -vv
```

#### Working on Feature
```bash
# Make changes and commit regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Add VRISTO sidebar component with Vue integration"

git add .
git commit -m "Implement responsive mobile sidebar behavior"

git add .
git commit -m "Add Alpine.js store for theme management"

# Push changes regularly
git push origin feature/vristo-template-integration
```

#### Completing Feature
```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
git status
git push origin feature/vristo-template-integration

# Create Pull Request via GitHub/GitLab interface
# Title: "Implement VRISTO Template Integration"
# Description: Detailed feature description and testing notes
# Target: feature/vristo-template-integration ‚Üí develop

# After PR approval and merge, cleanup
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/vristo-template-integration
git push origin --delete feature/vristo-template-integration
```

### 3. Parallel Feature Development

```bash
# Developer A: Working on authentication
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/authentication-system
# ... work on authentication ...

# Developer B: Working on dashboard (simultaneously)
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-ui
# ... work on dashboard ...

# Both features can be developed in parallel
# Each creates separate PR to develop
# Merge conflicts resolved during PR process
```

### 4. Release Process

#### Preparing Release
```bash
# When develop is ready for release
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
git push -u origin release/v1.0.0

# Update version numbers in files
# composer.json, package.json, etc.
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version to v1.0.0"

# Final testing and bug fixes on release branch
git add .
git commit -m "Fix responsive design issue in website table"

git add .
git commit -m "Update changelog for v1.0.0"
```

#### Completing Release
```bash
# Merge to main (production)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "SSL Monitor v3 v1.0.0 - Initial release"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop (sync any release fixes)
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v1.0.0
git push origin develop

# Cleanup release branch
git branch -d release/v1.0.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.0.0
```

### 5. Hotfix Process

#### Emergency Production Fix
```bash
# Critical issue discovered in production
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/ssl-certificate-validation-bug
git push -u origin hotfix/ssl-certificate-validation-bug

# Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "Fix SSL certificate validation logic for wildcard certificates"

# Test the fix thoroughly
git add .
git commit -m "Add test coverage for wildcard SSL certificate validation"
```

#### Deploying Hotfix
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/ssl-certificate-validation-bug
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "SSL Monitor v3 v1.0.1 - Fix SSL validation bug"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/ssl-certificate-validation-bug
git push origin develop

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# During rebase or merge
git status                          # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .                          # Mark as resolved
git rebase --continue              # Continue rebase
# OR
git commit                         # Complete merge
```

### Accidentally Committed to Wrong Branch
```bash
# Move commits to correct branch
git reset --soft HEAD~3            # Undo last 3 commits (keep changes)
git stash                          # Stash changes
git checkout correct-branch
git stash pop                      # Apply changes
git add . && git commit -m "Move commits to correct branch"
```

### Need to Update Feature Branch with Latest Develop
```bash
# Interactive rebase (preferred)
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase -i develop

# Or merge (creates merge commit)
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge develop
```

### Squash Multiple Commits Before PR
```bash
# Interactive rebase to squash commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5               # Last 5 commits
# In editor: change 'pick' to 'squash' for commits to combine
# Edit commit message
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/my-feature
```

## üìä Branch Protection Rules

### `main` Branch Protection
```yaml
Required Checks:
  - Tests pass (PHPUnit, Pest)
  - Code quality (Laravel Pint)
  - Security scan
  - Build succeeds

Restrictions:
  - Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
  - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits pushed
  - Require review from code owners
  - Restrict pushes to matching branches
  - Force push disabled

Branch Rules:
  - Delete head branches automatically after merge
  - Allow squash merging only
```

### `develop` Branch Protection
```yaml
Required Checks:
  - Tests pass
  - Code quality checks

Restrictions:
  - Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
  - Allow force pushes for maintainers only
  - Allow merge commits and squash merging
```

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- **Never** commit directly to `main` or `develop`
- **Never** force push to shared branches
- **Don't** mix multiple features in one branch
- **Don't** commit work-in-progress without clear marking
- **Don't** leave branches abandoned without cleanup
- **Avoid** large, monolithic commits
- **Don't** merge without proper review and testing
